# !! DANGER !!

# This workflow retrieves an OIDC identity token from GitHub Actions
# and INTENTIONALLY leaks it as an artifact. As a result, the leaked
# token is NOT SECRET AND MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED A VALID IDENTITY
# FOR SIGNING OR ANY OTHER PURPOSE.

# We generate 3 tokens per workflow run using identical jobs to work around GitHub Actions scheduling
# limitations. Each new token overwrites the previous token associated with the workflow artifact bundle,
# if it exists. Each run should take around 10 minutes to complete.
